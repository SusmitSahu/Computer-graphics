1. Cloud point reflection with respect to a given plane.
  The project here deals with the reflection of cloud points over a given plane. As the output of 3D scanning processes, point clouds are used for many purposes, including to create 3D CAD models for manufactured parts, for metrology and quality inspection, and for a multitude of visualization, animation, rendering and mass customization applications.

2. Bezier Curve using n control points

The project deals with approximating polynomial curve (type Bezier curve) for the given Np no of points. Here we discuss the order of the approximating curve and the continuity (1st continuity, 2nd continuity etc.) of the approximated curve.
Bezier curves are widely used in computer graphics to model smooth curves. As the curve is completely contained in the convex hull of its control points, the points can be graphically displayed and used to manipulate the curve intuitively. Affine transformations such as translation and rotation can be applied on the curve by applying the respective transform on the control points of the curve.
Quadratic and cubic Bezier curves are most common. Higher degree curves are more computationally expensive to evaluate. When more complex shapes are needed, low order Bezier curves are patched together, producing a composite Bezier curve. A composite Bezier curve is commonly referred to as a "path" in vector graphics languages (like PostScript), vector graphics standards (like SVG) and vector graphics programs (like Artline, Timeworks Publisher, Adobe Illustrator, CorelDraw, Inkscape, and Allegro). In order to join Bezier curves into a composite Bezier curve without kinks, a property called G1 continuous, it suffices to force the control point at which two constituent
